They reveal how these changes refine the information processing capabilities of an in vivo developing network, mainly by showing a developmental reduction in the instability of network's firing activity.",

The author analyzes this phenomenon primarily as a crisis of authority, connecting Biesta's critique with Arendt's concept of authority. The paper suggests that educational theory needs to rediscover the roots of the didactical tradition in rhetorics.",

Elevated gestational IL-13 concentrations were found to increase the risk for children to develop hyperactive/inattentive behavior, with no effect observed from maternal atopic dermatitis. The study highlights the importance of considering both maternal cytokines and polyunsaturated fatty acids in understanding neurobehavioral sequelae in offspring.",
